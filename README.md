Kali Linux Firewall Hardening Using GUFW

This project demonstrates host-based firewall hardening on a Kali Linux virtual machine using the GUFW graphical firewall interface.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to improve system security by:
- Restricting unnecessary open ports
- Allowing only required services
- Applying network-based access restrictions
- Enabling firewall logging and monitoring
- Verifying configurations using Nmap

## Tools Used
- Kali Linux (Virtual Machine)
- GUFW (Graphical Uncomplicated Firewall)
- UFW

## Key Security Configurations
- Removed unnecessary open ports (8080, 9090)
- Restricted SSH access to internal network only
- Blocked insecure legacy services
- Enabled detailed firewall logging
- Verified firewall behavior using terminal scans

## 📄 Documentation
The full step-by-step user guide and lab report is available in the PDF file included in this repository.
